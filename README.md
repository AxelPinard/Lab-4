- Factory Pattern
Abstracted the makeChange method in the Register class into 3 seperate mehtods, 1 mehtod supplys the denomination list, another method is a Factory method that supplys Purse objects
and the last one is the makeChange method that calls the other two classes in order to add change to them.
